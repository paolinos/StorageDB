StorageDB
=========

Database that simplify the use of indexeddb.

With StorageDB, you can use IndexedDB very easy.
In the demo file, you can Add/Get by id/ Get by parameter/ Remove and Destroy the db.

For the moment this don't have a AND operator, when you need to search.

In the v2, I will change a bit, trying to use the MongoDB logic, because indexedDB it's an NoSQL database, and nothing better that use a similar sintaxis like MongoDB.

But for the moment, you can use it, and also you can download and create your own DB.
